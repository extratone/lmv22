Star drivers such as ex-F1 driver Felix Rosenqvist, Williams F1 reserve driver Jack Aitken and FIA F2 star Liam Lawson all competed in one of the most hotly anticipated sim racing events of the year.<\/li>\n<li>Conditions were dry at Nordschleife, meaning drivers were able to push the pace on the soft tyre compounds and created lots of early drama with corners aplenty to take advantage of. The Norschleife saw plenty of action as the gruelling circuit\u2019s 150-plus corners, blind crests and little run off took its toll. Packed traffic made for some hair-raising encounters, one of the most significant of which occurred with an hour completed, as <strong>Race Clutch Alpine\u2019s<\/strong> <strong>Tom Lartilleux<\/strong> made contact with <strong>Team Project 1\u2019s<\/strong> <strong>Pero Stoyanov Peev<\/strong> and careened into the barriers.<\/li>\n<li>In the LMP2 Classification, the championship-leading <strong>#4<\/strong> <strong>Floyd- ByKolles-Burst<\/strong> started on pole position with <strong>Jesper Pedersen<\/strong> at the helm, and though the <strong>#22 GPX Rebellion Williams<\/strong> quickly snatched a lead at the start, <strong>Pedersen<\/strong> regained his position at the beginning of the second lap with some dominant driving. After thirty minutes and every car having pitted, <strong>Pedersen<\/strong> remained ahead but a surging <strong>Bono Huis<\/strong> behind the wheel of <strong>Team Redline\u2019s #123<\/strong>, who started fifth on the grid, eventually took first in an incredible duel with Pedersen. As more cars pitted again, <strong>Team Redline<\/strong> maintained its strong lead, and finished ahead over five seconds ahead of <strong>Floyd ByKolles-Burst <\/strong>in the 17<sup>th<\/sup> lap, and <strong>Team Fordzilla<\/strong> in third before the race was abandoned.<\/li>\n<li>In the LMGTE Classification, an incredible qualifying lap by<strong> Porsche Esports Team\u2019s<\/strong> <strong>Joshua Rogers<\/strong> saw him take pole position for the opening battles. The race was hair-raising from the start, with the pair of Porsche Esports Team cars managing to secure a one-two position early on at the start, while traffic further down in the pack fell foul of the notorious corners on turn one. The race continued its chaotic pace despite the red flags, where the leading <strong>Proton Competition Porsche<\/strong> narrowly avoided disaster after <strong>Muhammed Patel<\/strong> in the #10 <strong>MAHLE RACING TEAM<\/strong> LMP spun out. Near the half distance mark, championship-leading <strong>#91 Porsche Esports Team<\/strong> driven by <strong>Mack Bakkum<\/strong> hit the barriers and paved the way for <strong>TESLA R8G ESPORTS<\/strong> and <strong>Red Bull Racing Esports<\/strong> to capitalise and leapfrog into first and second place ahead of third-placed <strong>Proton Competition Porsche <\/strong>before the final red flag.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Jeffrey Rietveld<\/strong> for <strong>Realteam Hydrogen Redline<\/strong> recorded the fastest lap time in the LMP2 Classification, with a blistering 7:05.361 on the 12<sup>th<\/sup> lap, nearly two seconds better than the next best. Over in the LMGTE Classification, <strong>Dayne Warren<\/strong> for <strong>Proton Competition<\/strong> secured the fastest lap, recording an impressive 7:57.583 in the fourth lap.<\/li>\n<li>This weekend&#8217;s race saw server issues cut the race short at just over half distance to prevent potential disruption to competitors and viewers. A full investigation into the cause of the server problems has already been launched to prevent it from reoccurring, while half points were awarded to all teams.<\/li>\n<li>After the race <strong>Gerard Neveu<\/strong>,Motorsport Advisor to Motorsport Games commented, \u201cSeeing the Le Mans Virtual Series cars take the start on the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife was a great reward for our competitors\u2019 and partners\u2019 trust and enthusiasm for endurance esports. It was therefore even more disappointing when technical server issues caused the 8-hour race to be cut short. We sincerely apologise to everyone involved that they didn\u2019t have the race we expected, and want to reassure everyone that we are fully investigating why this happened in order to make sure it doesn\u2019t reoccur.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Just one more race remains in 2021, before the finale to the Le Mans Virtual Series season, the 24 Hours of Le Mans Virtual race on January 15\/16, 2022 which will be held live at the Autosport International Show at the NEC in Birmingham, UK.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Round 4 <\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0500 Miles of Sebring, USA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 December 18, 2021<\/li>\n<li><strong>Round 5 <\/strong>24 Hours of Le Mans Virtual\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 January 15\/16, 2022<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For further media information contact Fiona Miller, Miller Media &amp; Communications, on +44 7770 371332 or <a href=\"mailto:miller.media10@btinternet.com\">miller.media10@btinternet.com<\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; The 8 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring, the third round in the Le Mans Virtual Series, saw Team Redline and drivers [&hellip;]<\/p>","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":770,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v17.6 -
