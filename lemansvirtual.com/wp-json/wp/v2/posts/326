There will also be more focus on increased race and strategy analysis during broadcasts to boost fan interest and engagement.<\/p>\n<p>Bringing together the elite of motor racing and sim racing to compete together, the field of 38 LMP and GTE full-season entries must have a line-up of up to five drivers, with a combination of FIA international licensed and sim drivers.
