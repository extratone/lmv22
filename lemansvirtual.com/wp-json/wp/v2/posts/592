Star drivers such as Indycar driver Felix Rosenqvist, FIA F3 Vice Champion Jack Doohan and IndyCar\u2019s Sage Karam lined up for one of the most hotly contested sim racing events of the year.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As usual with Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, all eyes were on the sky as rain was forecast for the later hours of the race. However, dry conditions prevailed which meant drivers were able to push the pace on the soft tyre compounds. The lack of rain didn\u2019t hinder the race drama, with a number of dramatic moments in the race, such as an unfortunate mistake from Round 1 winner Realteam Hydrogen Redline that saw their LMP2 car hit the wall and retire from the race in the first hour.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the LMP2 Classification, RG8 Esports took the lead in the second hour and held the position for much of the race.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> However, in the final hour a strong challenge from Felix Rosenqvist\u2019s Team Redline proved too much, who alongside drivers Atze Kerkhof and Bono Huis took and held the race lead. They were followed 13s behind by Floyd ByKolles-Burst in second place, with Rebellion GPX Esports completing the podium &#8211; just missing out on 2nd by 0.4s!. Their second place finish means Floyd ByKolles-Burst now lead the LMP2 Championship by 2 points.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the LMGTE Classification, the three Porsche teams of Proton Competition and Porsche Esports Team looked very dominant in the opening hours, challenging to own all three podium spots. However, as the race went on BMW Team Redline applied continuous pressure, challenging the race favorites and eventually securing first place with less than ten minutes to go thanks to fuel saving throughout the race. Porsche Esports Team took 2nd and 3rd, the No.91 Porsche Esports Team just 1.7s behind the winner. Porsche Esports Team and BMW Team Readilne now sit tied at 43 points each in the LMGTE Team\u2019s championship.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fastest lap in the LMP2 class was Philippe Denes from MAHLE RACING TEAM, who secured a 1:58.894 time on the 51st lap. Over in LMGTE, Charlie Collins in the Proton Competition Porsche 911 RSR GTE was the fastest with a 2:13.075 lap time which he drove on his 49th lap.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Felix Rosenqvist from Team Redline said \u201cIt\u2019s been such a long preparation for this race. We all put so many hours in. In the end we have to thank the team with the amazing fuel saving strategy. There were some concerns about rain, but in the end it never came so we didn\u2019t need to worry about it. It was so much fun, with these races there\u2019s so much at stake all the time, when I did my two stints I was completely fried afterwards.\u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kevin Siggy from BMW Team Redline commented on the close finish in LMGTE \u201cThe final stint was very hard, with the fuel saving we had to do to get past the Porsche, but in the end we nailed the strategy and came out with first place. We ended the race with 0.4 litres of fuel, so it was very very close. After we passed the Porsche, it was about fuel saving as much as possible and making it to the end.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two more races remain in 2021, with the next round the 8 Hours of Nurburgring coming in 4 weeks, all before the finale to the Le Mans Virtual Series season, the 24 Hours of Le Mans Virtual race on January 15\/16, 2022 which will be held live at the Autosport International Show at the NEC in Birmingham, UK.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Round 3\u00a0 <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0\u00a08 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring, Germany\u00a0 \u00a0 November 13, 2021<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Round 4\u00a0 <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0\u00a0500 Miles of Sebring, USA\u00a0 \u00a0 December 18, 2021<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Round 5 <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a024 Hours of Le Mans Virtual\u00a0 \u00a0 January 15\/16, 2022<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The second round of the Le Mans Virtual Series, a thrilling 6 Hours of Spa race, has officially concluded with [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":593,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v17.6 -
